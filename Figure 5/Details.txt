"TrqToAct1000" contains a 8 x 30 x 20 x 1001 array indicating the resulting muscle torques generated my the muscles (8) at each elbow angle (30) and shoulder angle (20) at 1000 stimulation levels ranging from 0-1 (maximum stimulation). "MaxTrqsPerMuscle" are the max torques that can be generated by each muscle.  Both of these are used to test the performance of the lookup table and generate Figure 5.
